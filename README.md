## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or later
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Clerk account for authentication
- Cloudinary account for media storage

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VJ-E/Alumni-Connection-Platform.git
cd Alumni-Connection-Platform
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
# Install main dependencies
npm install

# Install realtime backend dependencies
cd realtime-backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. **Environment Setup**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding

# Cloudinary
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset

# Socket.IO
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 4. **Start Development Servers**

In separate terminal windows, run:

```bash
# Start Next.js development server
npm run dev

# Start Socket.IO server
cd realtime-backend
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. Push your code to a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository
2. Import the repository on Vercel
3. Add the same environment variables as in your `.env.local`
4. Deploy!

### MongoDB Atlas Setup

1. Create a new cluster on MongoDB Atlas
2. Set up a database user with read/write permissions
3. Add your IP to the IP whitelist
4. Get the connection string and update your environment variables

### Realtime Server

For production, you'll need to deploy the Socket.IO server separately (e.g., on Heroku, Railway, or render) and update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_SERVER_URL` environment variable accordingly.

---

## 🛡️ Security

- All API routes are protected with Clerk authentication
- Sensitive routes use server-side authentication checks
- Environment variables are used for sensitive configuration
- Input validation is implemented on both client and server
- Rate limiting is in place for authentication endpoints
